1. THE WAY OF THE PROGRAM


input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.
output: Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.
math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.

operators: special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication (+, -, *, /).

If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you:
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(42.0)
<class 'float'>
>>> type('Hello, World!')
<class 'str'>
