Python has these keywords:
False class finally is return None continue for lambda try True def from nonlocal while
and del global not with as elif if or yield assert else import pass break except in raise

String operations:
You normally can't perform mathematical operations on strings
>>>'chinese'-'food' = illegal

>>> first = 'throat'
>>> second = 'warbler'
>>> first + second
throatwarbler

>>>'spam'*3
'spam''spam''spam'
